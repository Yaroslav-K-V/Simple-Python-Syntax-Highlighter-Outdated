# Python Syntax Highlighter
The Python Syntax Highlighter Project is a GUI program designed to highlight the syntax of Python code. It allows users to write code and get visual hints about different elements of the programming language (keywords, comments, strings, etc.).

It's my first project that I created. I will be grateful for all the advice and notes.

## Quick Start
Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run the highlighter:
```bash
python main.py
```
